#+TITLE: README

Hey, you're reading Tom's Emacs config files! I hope a few of you get
some use out of them. 99% of my config is in the [[file:emacs-init.org][emacs-init.org]] file,
and that should be somewhat easy to follow if you know a little bit
about emacs. If you have any questions, open an issue or contact me at
[[mailto:tom@tompurl.com][tom@tompurl.com]].
